  And the culinary tradition in Egypt extends back more than 5 thousand years, that is, <br>
  since the time of the pharaohs.During the centuries that followed, local food,<br> 
  from ingredients and methods of preparation, imposed its control<br> over all the people who wandered 
  all over Egypt, including the Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Ottomans, French and British.<br>
  But what distinguishes Egyptian cuisine is the way these dishes are prepared with different 
  ingredients and flavors
